About Dataset
 Context
 Fakes and spammers are a major problem on all social media platforms, including
 Instagram.
 This is the subject of my final-year project in which I set out to find ways of detecting
 them using machine learning.
 In this dataset fake and spammer are interchangeable terms

Columns Overview:
 ● profile_pic: Binary (1 if the profile has a picture, 0 otherwise).
 ● nums/length username: Number of characters or numbers in the username.
 ● fullname words: Number of words in the full name.
 ● nums/length fullname: Character length and number count in the full name.
 ● name==username: Binary (1 if the username and full name are identical, 0
 otherwise).
 ● description length: Character length of the bio/description.
 ● external URL: Binary (1 if an external URL is present, 0 otherwise).

 ● #follows: Number of accounts followed.
